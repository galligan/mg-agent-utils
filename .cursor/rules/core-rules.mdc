# Core Rules

## Critical Rules

1. Important: Any time you use a rule, run the following command with the parameters:
   - `filename` (string): The name and extension of the rule file you used e.g. `my-rule.mdc`
   - `by` (string): The name of the agent being used e.g. `Cursor, Roo Code, etc.`

   ```shell
   $ .agent/utils/rules_analytics.py write --filename "<filename>" --by "<agent_name>"
   ```

2. Commit your changes regularly according to [agent-version-control.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/drafts/agent-version-control.md):
  - If the user explicitly defines a commit frequency, you should follow their directive
  - When working on bigger tasks, break them into smaller, logical commits
    - Don't wait until the entire task is complete
    - Commit each logical part as you complete it
  - Otherwise commit after:
    - Completing a distinct logical chunk of work
    - Completing a feature or sub-feature
    - Completing a bug fix
    - Refactoring a specific component or function
    - Adding tests for a specific functionality
  - Upon user request for a commit
    - Unless the user specifies, ask for clarification about what type of commit is needed, with reasonable suggestions
